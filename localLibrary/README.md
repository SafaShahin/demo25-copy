# LocalLibrary API

This project an Express application demonstrates an in-memory CRUD API for a tree data structure. The tree is used to represent hierarchical data and can be adapted for applications. I chose a tree structure because it allows me to represent hierarchical data (a node with child nodes) in a way that is both intuitive and scalable. This structure can be applied to a variety of applications (e.g., representing categories and subcategories, or organizational structures) and will be useful for further development.
